# D&D Wires Puzzle

> [!WARNING]
> If you are in my Eternal Vigil campaign and have not escaped the compact machine world, leave!

This project is a puzzle that will be (or was) given to my players in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. The puzzle consists of 3 steps:

1. First you must connect the wires like one of those pipe puzzles

2. After the wires are connected, you will be able to flip the switches along the side. Each switch is a bit and pressing the submit button enters an ascii letter. This is indicated by one of the status lights turning white.

3. Once the status bar is full, the word is submitted and follows wordle-style rules until the correct answer is entered.
